# Safer-Systems-Programming Safer-Systems-Programming is a two- part project to evaluate Rust as an uncommonly used programming language. 
#In part (a), I evaluate Rust using explicitly required criteria and inject a novel lens of cybersecurity as independent criteria. 
#For part (b), I develop and demonstrated a use-case to highlight findings. 
#The project stems from Master level coursework at George Washington University's SEAS.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74839431/173248893-63ec812e-036f-46d9-8309-213887efb66e.png)
